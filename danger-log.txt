Danger Log - Potential System Vulnerabilities

1.Severe Concurrent Occasions
Our UPS website uses the default transaction isolation of postgres, so it might 
experience difficulties when facing severe concurrent occasions. This may result 
in slow response times, possible downtime, and a degraded user experience.

Mitigation Steps: utilize optimistic and pessimistic locking


2.Privilege Escalation
Our current Docker container is running as root because the Gradle base image requires 
specific permissions to build and launch the application. This configuration might 
create a vulnerability in our server, allowing attackers to exploit the container for 
unauthorized access or malicious activity.

Mitigation Steps: Implement a least-privilege approach for the container, granting 
only the necessary permissions to run the application.
